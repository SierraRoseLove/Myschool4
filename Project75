        <p clas="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to
            consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menues
            with photographes of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
            parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
            provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keepstrack of their previous meal choises
            and any dietary require ments they have. Ordering  online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can
            eliminate all the fuss of money handaling, making it safer and less complicated for the staff and students alike.
            Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
                Humans are prone to error, even even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
                management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data
                entry. This accurate data therebye helps to provide accurate preformance and payroll data.
                <br>
                2. Economics
                Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end
                to inaccurate time reporting, body punching, absenteenism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
                of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large orginizations save up to $1,600 per employee after
                implementing automated attendance management systems.
                <br>
                3. Productivity / Efficiency
                Monitoring and managing attendance manualy can be time consuming, laborus, and expessive affair. It takes
                time to process paper sheets and time cards, create scheduels, authorize leave over time, and create
                payroll manualy. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from
                keeping track employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and
                effort saved combined with data accurancy helps optomizing the use of resources which lead to increased
                productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management,
